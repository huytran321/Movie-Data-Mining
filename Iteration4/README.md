iteration_4_original, updated_orginial, and Ur contains functions that predict 
what type of streaming platform the movie is on. All you need to do is change the number and 
see if the database guesses correctly.

To recreate these functions and see the graphs, you will need to use the "classification learner" 
application on MATLAB. 

First, you must run the Iteration_4.m file, then go over to the app section and click on the
classification learner app. After clicking on the app, go over to a new session, and click on from workspace.
Click on T and make sure the class indication is Streaming Platform. Then click on
holdout validation and then click start session. Go over to model type and find bagged trees in the 
ensemble section. After that hit train and you are done.

To analyze Ur, change T to Table_Ur and repeat the steps above.

To analyze the updated data, choose T, and remove any features you don't want in the workspace section.
